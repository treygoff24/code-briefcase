"""True Incremental Updates (P4) - File-level graph patching.

This module provides O(1) per-file updates to the call graph, instead of
rebuilding the entire graph on every file edit.

Key functions:
- compute_file_hash(file_path) - SHA-1 hash for content-based deduplication
- extract_edges_from_file(file_path, lang) - Extract edges from single file
- patch_call_graph(graph, edited_file, project_root, lang) - Patch graph incrementally
- has_file_changed(file_path, cached_hash) - Check if file content changed

Usage:
    from tldr.patch import patch_call_graph, compute_file_hash, has_file_changed

    # Check if file changed
    if has_file_changed(file_path, cached_hash):
        # Patch the graph for just this file
        graph = patch_call_graph(graph, file_path, project_root, lang="python")
